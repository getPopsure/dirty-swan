## Design values

### Simple Swan

We are a company that believes in the simplicity of things. We don't want to over complicate something that is already a thousand headed hydra at the best of times. We believe that problems can be solved elegantly but most importantly, simply.

We aren't ones to break the wheel, if it works we'll make full use of it. That's why we believe in a design system that is usable and reusable, designing with simplicity and durability in mind.

### Lego Swan

Our design system, like many before it, uses the fundamental methodology of Atomic Design. Building from what is as a foundation and continuously improving from what was.

We believe in building a solid foundation in order to continue solidly from where we began. Future proofing is one of our fundamental values and beliefs. Everything that we design and implement is done with future features in mind.
