# Inputs

Input elements are used to gather information from users.

We have defined a few different input components according to the use case:

- A default [Input](?path=/story/jsx-inputs-input--input-story) component
- A [Currency Input](?path=/story/jsx-inputs-currency-input--page) component that is meant to be used for entering amount in Euro
- An [Iban Input](?path=/story/jsx-inputs-iban-input--page) that is meant to be used when entering banking informations.
- A [AutoSuggestInput]() component allows quick search via the input field to find an option for selection.
- The [AutoSuggestMultiSelect]() component is a combination of the `AutoSuggestInput` and `Chip` components, where the selections are displayed above the input.

You are looking at the JSX definition of the Input component, if you want you can use the [css alternative](?path=/story/css-components-input--page)
