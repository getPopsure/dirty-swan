## AutoSuggestMultiSelect

This component allows quick search via the input field to find an option for selection.

Upon selecting an option, the option is displayed above the input field as a chip.

The chip can be removed by clicking on the X button. Multi options can be selected as well.

Prop `setValues` function must be provided to keep track of removed and added option selections.

## Example

  <AutoSuggestMultiSelect
    options={[
      { value: 'This is a test option' },
      { value: 'Here is another test option' },
      {
        value:
          'This is a very long option for testing and needs to be very long',
      },
    ]}
    selectedValues={[{ value: 'This is a test option' }]}
    setValues={() => {}}
    placeholder="Placeholder"
