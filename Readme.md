### Releasing a new version

To release a new version, use "Draft a new release" on GitHub (please refer to [Managing a release in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)). You'll need to specify a correct "Tag version" that is following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) (or semver).

GitHub Action will then automatically pick it up from there and release the new version for you.
