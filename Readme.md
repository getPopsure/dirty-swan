### Releasing a new version

You can release a new version using the `yarn version` command.
This will update `package.json` and add a [tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) to your commit.

You will then need to push your changes to the repository altogether with the tag.

`git push --follow-tags`
